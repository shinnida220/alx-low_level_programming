 * A pointer is simply the address of a piece of data in memory.
 * A pointer variable is a variable that stores the address of that piece of data. Like any other variable it needs to be declared.
 * General form is: var_type *var;
 * int *ptr;
 * char *ptr2
 * The * tells that the variable var is a pointerâ€¦
 * that points to a var_type.
 * The value of var will be a memory address holding a value of type var_type
 *
 * On most 64 bits machines, the size of pointers is 8 bytes.
